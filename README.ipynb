    "The project has several options for commands: `main`, `validate` and `deploy`. `main` trains and validates the model, `validate` performs validation only, and `deploy` builds a docker image for the model to run on the cloud as a REST service. Use `main`, or just `mlflow run .`, to develop the model, `validate` to test the model, and `deploy` to ship model to production.\n",

    "Used in this project is GitHub Actions. The following steps are run:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check code formatting\n",
    "- Test/validate model\n",
    "- Push of metrics and artifacts (model, ROC graphs for each class) into the cloud-hosted MLFlow server\n",
    "- Build model as a REST API, and package it as a docker container\n",
    "- Push docker container into the artifact registry\n",
    "- Apply updated Tearrform configuration, which includes kubernetes cluster, to update it to use newly built docker image\n",
